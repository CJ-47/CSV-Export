A CSV reader which can search ,export and filter data Offline as well as export to Google Sheeets (Sheets API)


Technology Stack used :
PyCharm IDE : Project Management  and Debugging
Programming Language : Python

Library Modules used : Numpy , Pandas 


Initially , I had initially planned to develop using Web based Application on React-NodeJS but I finalised a python environment based project as 
it will provide a hybrid environment to view/manage CSV in Offline(Export CSV) as well as Online Environment (Google Developers API ). 
The project uses TkinterDnD module for implementing Drag and Drop Feature and Entry Widget to implement User Input Space and action events .
It uses Label's for more informative GUI. It uses pandas , numpy for CSV Data manipulation which is pretty basic .
